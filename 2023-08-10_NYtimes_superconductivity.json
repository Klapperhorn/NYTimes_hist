When it escapes from the caverns where it has collected over the eons, it mixes with air, rises into the atmosphere and escapes, but it can be captured from the deposits.

By Richard P. Brennan. (John Wiley & Sons, $18.95.) A layman's survival guide to our high-technology world is one of those things you don't know you're missing until you hold it in your hands. In fact, it is long overdue. More than one-third of the college students across three states polled by the University of Texas in 1988 said they believed in Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, unidentified flying objects and the lost city of Atlantis. Richard P. Brennan, a long-time science writer, writes in ''Levitating Trains and Kamikaze Genes'' that people misinformed about science have little hope of coping with the increasingly rapid changes our future appears to hold. Mr. Brennan offers his book to provide ''what an otherwise educated person should know [about technology] and no more.'' As promised, the author distills basic information about the current state of research on space, biology, computers, the environment, energy, superconductivity, medicine, transportation and weaponry down to 262 pages of usually easy-to-read text. The book begins with a 50-question test of technological literacy. It then steps systematically through technologies, carefully explaining such facts as ''a light year is a measure of distance, not time,'' and ''it is a mistake to think of a computer as a thinking machine; it is not.'' Computers, Mr. Brennan assures us, do not think: they merely do what we tell them to do with incredible speed. From such simple facts, the author progresses to explaining more complex ideas, from how and why installing superinsulated windows in buildings throughout the United States could save tens of billions of dollars each year to a discussion of why advancing nuclear weapons technology is giving defense analysts fits. There are places where Mr. Brennan's simplified explanations are still not simple enough for the average reader, and one can think of some topics that just didn't make it into this book, but Mr. Brennan answers a lot of the questions you felt too foolish to ask. Knowing the answers is important to your future.", "print_section": "7", "print_page": "20", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "  TEST YOUR TECHNOLOGICAL LITERACY", "kicker": "IN SHORT: SCIENCE BOOKS", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "IN SHORT: SCIENCE BOOKS;

By Bruce Schechter. (Simon & Schuster, $19.95.) The men and women who push back the frontiers of knowledge in the physical sciences sometimes seem to be viewed by society as quiet, cloistered ''techies'' and ''labbies.'' In ''The Path of No Resistance,'' Bruce Schechter opens up their world, revealing the passions, humor, jealousies and brilliance of the people who have taken a once quiet back lane of science and transformed it into an international raceway of competitive technology. Mr. Schechter, a freelance science writer, traces the development of superconductivity (the virtual absence of electrical resistance) from its birth in the Leiden laboratories of Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911 through to the months of frantic research that resulted in a new class of high-temperature superconducting materials and the award of the 1987 Nobel Prize for physics. Competition for the discoveries to be made in high-temperature superconducting materials was furious and worldwide in 1986 and 1987 in laboratories across the United States, Europe and Japan. All were seeking development of materials that would make possible superconductivity in materials at temperatures far above the neighborhood of absolute zero (nearly 460 degrees below zero Fahrenheit). The prize was more than a Nobel Prize, for high-temperature superconductors may transform technologies as disparate as transportation, energy storage and computers. Mr. Schechter is gifted in providing an account of this research that contrasts the supposedly open world of shared research results with the manipulations of the real world of fast-paced international teams.

The police also besieged others at Cairo's Al-Azhar mosque, witnesses said. 8 News analysis: The Soviet economy entered a new era as Moscow initiated a program under which workers are being asked to change their notion of work without having early rewards from years of economic experiments. 1 In televised New Year's greetings by President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev to the Soviet and American people, Mr. Reagan told millions of Soviet viewers about freedoms unavailable in their country. 1 Britain suppressed information about the causes of a major nuclear accident, a fire at a British nuclear plant in 1957. The Prime Minister feared it would threaten cooperation with the United States, documents show. 3 In Cambodia, the Prime Minister has reassumed the position of Foreign Minister. The move by Prime Minister Hun Sen may affect the tentative peace process in that country. 24 A Bangkok hotel fire killed 13 people and injured 36 others.

The sense that there is too much to do is especially acute at this time of year. Yet people cannot seem to resist piling on more. 1 In Idaho, laws against harassment because of religion or race have been passed in communities surrounding the headquarters of a neo-Nazi sect. ''This community has been examining its conscience,'' one legislator said. 9 Philadelphia's police are improving but have ''not yet fully escaped the powerful pressures of the past that permit misconduct and result in lower standards of policing,'' a citizen's group said. 9 A California smoking ban on planes, trains and buses took effect, but at least two airlines ignored the law, saying superseding Federal regulations allowed smoking sections. 44 Gary Hart's 1988 campaign funds cannot be claimed by two of his creditors to satisfy debts from 1984, a Federal magistrate ruled, saying that the current campaign organization was a distinct legal entity from the 1984 organization. 9 A judge shortage poses a problem that is not likely to be resolved soon because of budget pressures, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said in a year-end report on the Federal judicary. The shortage is among both trial and appellate judges. 10 A.H. Robins accepted a takeover bid from Sanofi of France. Sanofi will pay $600 million for 58 percent of Robins and will guarantee bank loans to a trust fund for women claiming injuries from the Dalkon Shield. 29 The PTL ministry's trustee will take action to recover what the Internal Revenue Service says is $9.36 million in excessive compensation paid to Jim and Tammy Bakker, an attorney for the trustee said. 9 A motor tied to superconductivity has been developed by scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory. It is the first electrical motor based on the properties of the material that conducts electricity with minimal resistance. 10 Dallas trash, from cans to bags 9 Monsignor accuses South Carolina Republicans of racism 10 REGIONAL 25-27 A Coliseum site development plan has been approved by the Koch administration. The new plan makes no reference to the height of the project, reduces its purchase price and places a new financial constraint on the developer. 1 In the schools chancellor battle, the president of the New York City Board of Education and the head of the teachers union moved closer in deciding who should hold the post. 1 News analysis: The chancellor's job is the focus in a battle over whether the person hired should be an outsider, unencumbered by existing loyalties, or an insider, someone steeped in the system's bureaucracy. 27 Chancellor candidate is perceived as teachers' ally 27 Despite a shortage of hospital beds in New York City, an average of 2,000 beds a day are occupied by patients who are medically ready for discharge and do not belong there, government and health care officials said. 25 Some defendants on New Year's Eve waited in a holding pen behind the courtroom of Judge Joel M. Goldberg, waiting to be arraigned. Judge Goldberg presides over the first and perhaps the most undesirable full court session of the year. 25 Noise and excitement in Stamford on New Year's Eve were the signs of the successful staging of a family-style, arts-oriented and alcohol-free celebration. More than 10,000 people attended. 25 Dreams and fears of the new year were expressed by New Yorkers on the first day of 1988. While some people said they had concrete plans for what they wanted to accomplish, others expressed anxiety about what the year would bring. 25 The first Democratic chief executive in Suffolk County in 16 years was inaugurated. At the hourlong ceremony, the chief executive, Patrick G. Halpin, described the county as an area ''on the edge of greatness.'' 27 About New York: Composer, at 75, gets his big break 25 Two officers find cache of guns and drugs in Queens house 26 Lawyers seek court order in Zibabwean child abuse case 27 Neediest Cases 28", "print_section": "1", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "NEWS SUMMARY SATURDAY, JANUARY 2, 1988", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "NEWS SUMMARY SATURDAY, JANUARY 2, 1988", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "NEWS SUMMARY (NYT)", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1988-01-02 05:00:00+00:00", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "section_name": "New York", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Summary", "_id": "nyt://article/951862e3-7fbc-5b33-9511-acb3453cfbe2", "word_count": 1064, "uri": "nyt://article/951862e3-7fbc-5b33-9511-acb3453cfbe2"}, {"abstract": "LEAD: A wonder drug for heart-attack victims.

Augusto Pinochet was ''marked by an immense immorality.'' 3 A novel chronicling Stalin's terror, ''Children of the Arbat,'' has been excerpted in a Soviet weekly magazine, drawing to the attention of Soviet readers one of the most painful periods in the country's history. 1 An election contest in South Africa has focused attention on Somerset West, about 25 miles from Cape Town, where the ruling party is being challenged by a defector in the whites-only election. 1 Britain's first toad tunnel opened under the lethal Henley roadway in Hambleden, just in time for the mating season. The miniature tunnel is designed to help shepherd toads across a busy road to the mating ponds. 1 A trial on the Chernobyl disaster will begin ''soon'' in Kiev, said aSoviet official who said he did not know how many people would be prosecuted over the events at the nuclear power plant. 6 Debate about damage to a ferry that capsized off Belgium a week ago is now focusing on whether the propellers of the Herald of Free Enterprise were harmed and if she hit the harbor wall off Zeebrugge. 3 Declassification of the ABM treaty negotiating record was urged by Senator Sam Nunn so the public could evaluate the Administration's assertion that the agreement would allow ''Star Wars'' testing. 2 Greece's satirical tradition persists in language that is sometimes vulgar and often lacerating that spoofs political leaders and policies. ''Greeks,'' said one comedian, ''can laugh at themselves.'' 4 Six VW executives were suspended in a management shake-up following disclosures of a major foreign exchange swindle, Volkswagen A.G. said. Currency dealers said the action affected virtually all of the company's foreign exchange trading department. 37 Paris vows fight against terrorism 5 Prague group honors founder 6 NATIONAL 7-9, 34, 54 The Washington Post did not libel the former president of the Mobil Oil Corporation, a Federal appeals court ruled. The court reversed a $2 million judgment against the newspaper. 1 Payments for conserving farmland are more popular among American farmers than expected. Under a new Government program, nearly 19.5 million acres of highly erodible land have been removed from crop production. 7 The end of an era in Houston is how many residents describe the recent loss of local control over two of the city's most powerful home-grown institutions, The Houston Chronicle and Texas Commerce Bancshares. 7 Stanford University has a prototype electronic device made out of a new class of superconducting materials, scientists reported, indicating progress in superconductivity may come sooner than expected. 7 Japan will study superconducting materials in a government-coordinated effort to find commercial applications, said Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry, which organized a successful push into microelectronics. 7 Transplanting brain tissue from aborted fetuses in an effort to aid people suffering from Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease has won support from a panel of medical, ethical and legal experts. 54 Richard Secord sent an angry letter to a book publisher last week touching on some issues that have been raised in the Iran-contra affair. The retired general has refused to testify about his role in the affair. 8 Criticism of the pace of an inquiry into the Iran-contra affair has come from the leaders of the Senate committee investigating the case, who say they are impatient with the work of Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel. 8 The President has not backed away from his view that his Iran policy initiative had deteriorated into a trade of arms for hostages, the White House spokesman said, responding to the White House counsel's statement that Mr. Reagan still believed in his Iran policy. 8 Hope for Arab-U.S. relations was voiced by Senator Bob Dole in an overture to Arab-Americans in the United States. His statements appeared part of an effort to portray himself as a consensus politician. 9 Industrial production rose five-tenths of 1 percent in February, the fifth straight monthly increase, the Federal Reserve Board estimated. Many analysts said the rise, though less than expected, showed that the economy continued to grow. 37 Georgia Power Co. may proceed with full power operation of the Unit 1 reactor at the Vogtle Nuclear Power plant in east Georgia, following a Nuclear Regulatory Commission vote. 34 Teen-ager expelled for modeling 9 Public hospitals ask help with poor 28 REGIONAL 29-32 John Gotti was acquitted, as were his six co-defendants, of Federal racketeering and conspiracy charges in the Government's first major setback in its recent assault on organized crime. 1 A weakness in the prosecution's case was its reliance on turncoat career criminals as key witnesses against Mr. Gotti and 6 co-defendants, many lawyers and prosecutors who followed the seven-month trial said. 1 Mr. Gotti is said to be ruthless, according to prosecutors, who believe he is the boss of the Gambino family, the power behind an empire of loan-sharking, extortion, hijacking, robbery and murder. 32 A Farmingdale, L.I., plant will close by the end of the year as a result of the Air Force and Fairchild Industries' announcement that their contract for the T-46A training plane has been canceled. More than 2,500 jobs will be eliminated. 1 Lawyers in the Howard Beach case say they will make an issue at trial of the finding that the victim had cocaine in his system when he was killed. The lawyers represent two of the youths charged with murder. 29 3 state rent examiners testified that their superiors at the New York Division of Housing and Community Renewal ordered them to close outstanding landlord-tenant disputes improperly to disguise the agency's inefficiency. 29 12th casino changes Atlantic City 29 Ex-officer in drug treatment 29 Suicide-prevention efforts added 30 Youths' mourners vent anguish 30 Panel would raise Koch's pay 31 Grand Central arrests criticized 31", "print_section": "1", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "NEWS SUMMARY: SATURDAY, MARCH 14, 1987", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "NEWS SUMMARY: SATURDAY, MARCH 14, 1987", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "NEWS SUMMARY (NYT)", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1987-03-14 05:00:00+00:00", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "section_name": "New York", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Summary", "_id": "nyt://article/63583d2f-e417-5508-bf1a-7442303c8f64", "word_count": 1118, "uri": "nyt://article/63583d2f-e417-5508-bf1a-7442303c8f64"}, {"abstract": "LEAD: Scientists at Stanford University, in what could lead to rapid advances in superfast computers, reported today that they had succeeded in making a prototype electronic device out of a new class of superconducting materials.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/14/us/stanford-reports-advance-in-use-of-a-superconductor.html", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "Scientists at Stanford University, in what could lead to rapid advances in superfast computers, reported today that they had succeeded in making a prototype electronic device out of a new class of superconducting materials.", "print_section": "1", "print_page": "7", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "STANFORD REPORTS ADVANCE IN USE OF A SUPERCONDUCTOR", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "STANFORD REPORTS ADVANCE IN USE OF A SUPERCONDUCTOR", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Stanford University", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Research", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DATA PROCESSING", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1987-03-14 05:00:00+00:00", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "National Desk", "section_name": "U.S.", "byline": {"original": "By Andrew Pollack, Special To the New York Times", "person": [{"firstname": "Andrew", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Pollack", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}, {"firstname": null, "middlename": null, "lastname": null, "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 2}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/eef0b271-494c-5e25-85fa-abddaaf66aaa", "word_count": 797, "uri": "nyt://article/eef0b271-494c-5e25-85fa-abddaaf66aaa"}, {"abstract": "LEAD: PLUNGING toward the impossible, scientists on three continents are racing to achieve one of the great dreams of science - an everyday material that carries electricity without the slightest loss of energy.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/10/science/electricity-rushes-into-a-new-era-of-discovery.html", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "PLUNGING toward the impossible, scientists on three continents are racing to achieve one of the great dreams of science - an everyday material that carries electricity without the slightest loss of energy.", "print_section": "C", "print_page": "1", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "ELECTRICITY RUSHES INTO A NEW ERA OF DISCOVERY", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "ELECTRICITY RUSHES INTO A NEW ERA OF DISCOVERY", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Research", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTRICITY", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1987-03-10 05:00:00+00:00", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Science Desk", "section_name": "Science", "byline": {"original": "By James Gleick", "person": [{"firstname": "James", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Gleick", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/a8670094-286e-519e-99e0-23772220899e", "word_count": 2390, "uri": "nyt://article/a8670094-286e-519e-99e0-23772220899e"}, {"abstract": "LEAD: In the imperfect world of physical phenomena, superconductivity seems almost too good to be true.

A fundamental danger, as the Yale physicist Alan Chodos writes in American Scientist, is that experiments essential to testing new theories in physics will soon be beyond man's capacity to perform. Unable to mount experiments that would require energies comparable to that of the Big Bang genesis event, Dr. Chodos believes, growing numbers of physicists will be tempted to embrace grandiose but untestable theories, a practice that has more than once led science into blind alleys, dogma and mysticism.   In particular, Dr. Chodos worries that ''faddish'' particle physicists have begun to flock all too uncritically to a notion called ''superstring theory.'' That theory, which purports to interrelate all of nature's forces, including gravity, and all possible particles, is a kind of ''theory of everything,'' as Dr. Chodos expresses it - ''the Holy Grail of the Ultimate Theory.'' The great weakness of superstring theory, he contends, is that one of the key relationships it describes could be verified only at a scale of distances more than 100 quintillion quintillion times smaller than the particles that make up atomic nuclei. To imagine that anyone could ever measure anything at such an infinitessimal scale is just plain silly, he believes.", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/08/science/physics-may-be-up-against-the-wall-this-time.html", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "THERE is a nagging suspicion abroad that the science of physics may be on its death bed.", "print_section": "C", "print_page": "3", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "PHYSICS MAY BE UP AGAINST THE WALL THIS TIME", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "PHYSICS MAY BE UP AGAINST THE WALL THIS TIME", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Chodos, Alan", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Research", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Tests and Testing", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Physics", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1986-07-08 05:00:00+00:00", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Science Desk", "section_name": "Science", "byline": {"original": "By Malcolm W.
