First he helped introduce the New York version of Google Transit. Then he rollerbladed 20 blocks north and west to the unveiling of the new HTC G1 phone, the first that uses Google's Android phone software.   (Photo: Google's founders Larry Page, left, and Sergey Brin introduced the G1 on Tuesday in New York. (Credit: Jacob Silberberg/Reuters)) Someone at Google must not have searched for what happens on the East Side of New York in late September -- the neighborhood was clogged as limousines shuttled dignitaries around for the opening of the United Nations session. Mr. Brin said he found that even on rollerblades, his path was blocked.   Blocking anything, however, was not on the agenda at the press event, held in a cavernous space under the 59th Street Bridge. Executives of Google, HTC and T-Mobile, the first carrier to introduce the phone, used the word \"open\" more often than a gaggle of pediatric dentists.   When I caught up with Mr. Brin after the news conference, he talked about how Google has worked to loosen the grip that the notoriously controlling cellphone industry has on their networks. \"I like to give ourselves a little bit of credit,\" Mr. Brin said. \"We tend to take what could be viewed as a radical position on openness. Over time, most of the carriers understand that giving their customers more choices will expand usage.\"   Without saying so, this talk of openness was meant to imply a contrast with Apple, which has the right to restrict what applications are allowed on the iPhone and exercises that power without any public explanation of its policies.   (It has now been 11 days since Natalie Kerris in Apple's PR office wrote me that she would look into a question about a podcasting application Apple banned from the iPhone. I have heard nothing back, despite several follow up e-mail messages.)   After speaking to Mr. Brin, I met with Cole Brodman, the chief development officer of T-Mobile, and asked him what limits T-Mobile would impose on applications.   The G1 is certainly not totally open. On some phones, like BlackBerries and Palm Treos, people simply can install applications right on the phone without asking anyone. For Android phones, all applications must be installed through an application store run by Google. Still, the process is simply meant to prevent malicious applications, he said.  \"Our ground rules are very simple,\" he said. \"The application developer has to verify they are who they are. They have to certify the application does what it does. And they have to inform the user what the application does.\"   What about a voice-over-Internet-Protocol application like Skype that would let a G1 user bypass T-Mobile's network? That's fine, he said.   \"The device is already sold with a voice and data plan, so you can connect through T-Mobile anywhere in the world,\" he explained. \"So we think we have already solved the hard part. If someone wants to write a voice-over-IP application that will allow additional ways to connect, that is something the platform will allow.\"   And what about some video application that might use a lot of wireless bandwidth? There Mr. Brodman offered an asterisk.   \"Today, we are not imposing bandwidth rules on the applications,\" he said. \"In the future, we will have to look at how to efficiently use network bandwidth.\" He suggested that the carrier may impose restrictions or ask for payments from applications that use a lot of bandwidth and also make money, like from advertising.   Later, I saw Broadband Reports write that the fine print of T-Mobile's new data plan for the Android phone allows the company to restrict usage for people who use more than 1 gigabyte of data each month.   I wrote to Mr. Brodman to clarify this, and I'll update this post when he writes back.   The answers to my questions about bandwidth, and even VOIP, show how Google is in a very different position to talk about openness than wireless carriers and so many other companies. As much as users want T-Mobile to permit them to do absolutely anything with their phones, the company has to consider the costs of its bandwidth, the potential loss of lucrative voice minutes and so on.   Right now, Google is not managing any details to make sure the Android initiative makes money. Indeed, Mr. Brin said that Android has no revenue associated with it whatsoever. The software is given free to HTC and other phone makers. And Google isn't even going to run the application store to make a profit.   Of course, since its search, maps, e-mail and other services are woven through the Android software, the company has ample places on which it can sell ads.   When I asked Mr. Brin how well the HTC G1 would do in the market against Apple's iPhone, he said he didn't care. The point of the effort was simply to get more people using the Internet on mobile devices on the assumption that Google will get its usual (and very high) share of search traffic.   \"The iPhone is a great phone,\" Mr. Brin said. \"The G1 is a great phone. The more highly capable phones that are out there, the happier we will be.\"   At that, I left Mr. Brin to lace up his rollerblades and skate off to Google's offices in Chelsea, far from the diplomats' limos.
