But is this the beginning of a deeper shift in how corporations and their employees work?", "lead_paragraph": "My article today talks about how more and more companies are rethinking the face-to-face meeting -- when it makes productive sense to travel for that essential in-person experience and when that is no longer necessary, mainly because of advances in computing and telecommunications technology.   Rising fuel and travel costs are one motivation, of course. But the real issue is whether we are seeing the beginning of a deeper shift in how corporations and their employees work. Is this more a cyclical reaction to short-term economic pain or a structural phenomenon that will play out for years?   The truth is that it's too early for a definitive answer. And yes, technologies like traditional videoconferencing have been disappointing in the past. But there are several signs that something significant is underway this time.   At the high end, the new digital conferencing systems deliver a meeting experience -- dubbed telepresence -- that is eerily like real life. The images of people on screen are life-sized. At the end of meetings, participants have been known to walk to the screen to try to shake hands.  Companies like Cisco and Hewlett-Packard report brisk sales of the systems, while AT&T recently jumped into a networking, maintenance and support deal with Cisco. The Indian outsourcer Tata Consulting is going to provide telepresence rooms that businesses can rent.   For large corporations, the telepresence systems, though costly, can help curb travel, improve productivity and accelerate innovation. Procter & Gamble -- not a company in the business of adopting new technology for its own sake -- has installed 43 systems in little over a year.  But the more interesting place to look, in some ways, is the increased use and utility of more mainstream digital tools of collaboration: Web conferencing, online document sharing, wikis, group instant messaging and Internet telephony. The audio and desktop presentations in Web-based meetings, for example, are now more likely to be in sync and natural, instead of breaking up all the time. At I.B.M., Michael Littlejohn, a consultant, explained that putting together a big consulting proposal used to involve gathering eight or 10 people in one location, working for weeks. Today, he said, 75 percent of that work is done in virtual meetings, using Web-based tools.  The economics and the accumulating advances in technology may be aligned to bring another big evolutionary step in corporate work and travel patterns. There are analogies with changes in the past. The Internet itself took years, and steady investment, to become mainstream, and even then it disrupted industry after industry a decade after those predictions were made in the 1990s.  In this case, there are also environmental pressures, as the impact of business flights and car trips are recognized, and companies face the prospect that they will be held accountable for their carbon footprint before long. That motivation is already evident in Europe, where 56 percent of businesses in a recent survey said their use of collaboration and conferencing technology was influenced by concerns about climate change, according to Wainhouse Research, a consulting firm.  \"I think the inflection point will be over the next year or two, when a lot of companies, especially large ones, will look at these digital technologies for virtual meetings and teleworking, become more familiar with them and do more work this way,\" said Jonathan Koomey, a research scientist at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

But this merger also raises important questions about the future of the Internet itself, and about how much giant companies like AT&T will be allowed to control access to it. The health and future of the economy depend on the Internet's remaining a level playing field. So AT&T should be prevented from violating the principle of Internet neutrality, which holds that consumers should be given equal access to Web sites. Regulators must demand it from AT&T as a condition of this deal, and Congress should enact a law ensuring that it applies across the board.

Pushes Market Gauges Up  The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.27 points, or 1.13 percent, to a record 1,279.64, after the Government announced a surprising surge in United States economic growth.    Other market gauges also soared. The Nasdaq composite index surpassed 2,500 points for the first time, increasing 28.55 points, to 2,505.89, and wrapping up its biggest monthly gain in 24 years. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 77.50 points, to 9,358.83, with I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard accounting for almost half of the gain. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.08 percent, from 5.10 percent on Thursday. [Page C3.]    The nation's gross domestic product increased at a 5.6 percent annual rate in the final quarter of 1998. This marked the fastest pace in two years and made 1998 the third consecutive year that the economy had expanded at a nearly 4 percent pace. [A1.]    Several Airlines Increase Fares  Several major airlines, including Delta and Northwest, announced across-the-board fare increases, which if successful would be the first in more than two years. But some airlines had not gone along with the price increases as of late yesterday, indicating that their success was far from assured. [C2.]    Microsoft Data Public, Court Rules  A Federal appeals court has decided that all the deposition transcripts and videotapes in the Microsoft antitrust trial must be made public. That includes the 20 hours of taped deposition testimony of William H. Gates, the chairman of the software giant, as well as about 100 other depositions taken by the Government or the company. [C2.]    Breakthrough in Banana Fight  After five days of intense wrangling, members of the World Trade Organization reached a compromise in a politically charged dispute over bananas between the United States and European Union, averting a major rift at least for now. [C2.]    Vice President Al Gore told the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, that the financial crisis of 1998 could become ''the trade crisis of 1999,'' and said the United States would seek the elimination of enormous subsidies that European nations provide to their farmers. [A5.]    S.E.C. Halts Trades of USA Talks  The Securities and Exchange Commission suspended trading in the shares of the start-up Internet telephony company USA Talks.com after they almost quadrupled in less than a month, to a market value of $1.3 billion. The agency said questions had been raised about ''the accuracy and adequacy of public information'' about the company, including questions about the status and extent of its business operations. [C3.]    Kellogg's Earnings Drop 40%  Shares of Kellogg fell $1.4375, to $40.625, after it said fourth-quarter profit excluding one-time adjustments fell more than 40 percent, reflecting stiffer competition and less consumer appetite for cereal. The results were in line with analysts' estimates, which had been revised downward more than once. Kellogg's chief executive, Arnold G. Langbo, conceded that ''our financial results are disappointing.'' [C2.]    Nokia Profits Rise 72% in Quarter  The cellular phone maker Nokia reported a 72 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings, topping analysts' expectations. The Finnish company's profit rose to 3.474 billion markkaa ($666 million), or 6.09 markkaa a share. Analysts had expected a net profit of 3.2 billion markkaa.
